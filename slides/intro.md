# Prerequisites

- Have heard of docker
- Drupal-project, and composer-based Drupal 8 development.

Notes: 
Prerequisites for this talk:

- You're a developer or devops member.
- You've heard of Docker.
- You're highly familiar with d8 composer-based drupal site development, or you have a friend who knows a guy who mentioned to you once that it's a thing.  Not really important to understand ddev, other than the examples use it.

# What is DDEV?

- Docker management tool for dummies
- Alternative: Docksal
- Alternative: Docker4Drupal
- Alternative: Lando
- Alternative: Docker-Compose!

Notes: 
  - What is ddev (sneak preview: a docker management tool for dummies!)
  - Why did we choose ddev?  We have a shoestring budget, and no dedicated devops team, and it worked out of the box.
  - Alternatives exist.  If you like them, awesome.  I have no opinion on them, other than for us, they were harder to get working than ddev.
